Introduction
============

This tutorial will introduce the main constructs of the AOSB framework and
how to use them to build an aspect oriented synthetic biology design. However,
it is not written as an in-depth tutorial into thinking about synthetic biology
systems in terms of cross-cutting concern separation and aspect modularization.
It simply serves as an introduction to the AOSB language defined by the framework.

Prerequisites
=============

AOSB is a framework for Python 2.7. The tutorial assumes at least basic knowledge
of the Python programming language and object oriented programming as well as a
conceptual awareness of aspect oriented programming.

The AOSB package must also be added to the Python path.

Hello World
===========

AOSB allows a genetic circuit, i.e. a synthetic biology "program" to be defined
and manipulated in Python. Let us start by creating a simple example. In an empty
Python file, first import the AOSB framework::

    from aosb import *

Next, we will define a simple genetic circuit expressing an undefined Protein::

    class SimpleCircuit(Circuit):
        def mainCircuit(self):
            self.addPart(Promoter)
            self.addPart(RBS)
            self.addPart(CodingRegion(Protein))
            self.addPart(Terminator)

Every AOSB design must begin with a circuit, and every circuit needs to define 
a mainCircuit() method. Similarly to a main method in most modern programming
languages, this method defines the beginning of the synthetic biology design. 

The Circuit class provides the addPart method, which we are using to add four parts
to the design. The order of instruction matters and sets the order in which the parts
appear in the circuit.

Lastly, to view the defined genetic circuit, we must "compile" our design using
the AOSB.Weaver::

    compiledDesign = Weaver(SimpleCircuit).output()
    print compiledDesign
    
Running the entire file should give this output::

    Promoter+RBS+CodingRegion(codesFor = Protein)+Terminator
    
Parts and Molecules
===================

In the `Hello World`_ example, we have used two basic building blocks of AOSB: 
Parts and Molecules.

Every "instruction" in the genetic circuit is a ``Part``, added to the execution flow via ``addPart()``. Parts follow a strict hierarchy, as seen in the UML diagram.

.. figure:: /images/part_uml.png
    
    Hierarchy of AOSB built in Part classes.

All Parts have the capacity to be connected to a Molecule class. Of the standard parts, ``CodingRegion``, ``PositivePromoter`` and ``Negative Promoter`` require a Molecule class to be specified. For example, in the `Hello World`_ example, the coding region is initialized with `Protein`, a built in sub class of `Molecule`.

Additionally, the Weaver assigns Part attributes ``before`` and ``after``, to refer to the Parts before and
after it in the Part list, and a ``namespace`` attribute, referring to the Circuit or Aspect which added it.

.. warning::

   Molecules are always used as **classes**, not as objects. This is because they 
   represent an interaction of a Part with a **type** of Molecule, not just a specific
   Molecule. 
   
   On the other hand, Parts are always used as objects. However, for syntactic 
   convenience, if a Part requires no parameters to be initialized, ``addPart()``
   accepts Part classes and automatically converts them into objects. This can be seen
   in the `Hello World`_ example: The Promoter, RBS and Terminator Parts are added
   as classes. This is equivalent to adding them as an object, i.e.
   ``addPart(Promoter())``. The ``CodingRegion`` class however needs a Molecule to be
   instantiated, and thus needs to be added as an object.
   
Parts are a central element of AOSB, because they represent the basic building blocks of
the synthetic biology target.

Because each part is a class, new or more concrete Parts and Molecules
can be added in the normal Python way, potentially defining additional attributes::
    
    # Parts Registry RBS (http://parts.igem.org/Help:Ribosome_Binding_Site)
    class BBa_B0030	(RBS):
        sequence = "attaaagaggagaaa"
        bindingEfficiency = 0.6
        
    # declare that a class of Proteins called exists that are used as markers
    class ReporterProtein (Protein):
        pass

Creating new, specialized Parts and Molecules will be a frequent occurance in an 
AOSB program,
so the language also provides the ``declareNewPart`` and ``declareNewMolecule``
convenience functions::

    declareNewMolecule("GFP",ReporterProtein)
    # after this line, a new class GFP has been exported to the namespace
    
    declareNewPart("GFPCodingRegion",CodingRegion,GFP)
    # a new class GFPCodingRegion, subtype of CodingRegion has been created
    # the third parameter can specify a Molecule
    
``declareNewMolecule`` can accept more than one parent class of type Molecule, so that
a Molecule could be tagged by various classes, e.g. ReporterProtein, FluorescentProtein,
etc. This will be useful once we start selecting Molecules with point cuts. See the
reference on :py:func:`declareNewPart() <aosb.core.declareNewPart>` and
:py:func:`declareNewMolecule() <aosb.core.declareNewMolecule>` for more information.

Aspects
=======

The purpose of AOSB is to allow synthetic biology core and cross-cutting concerns 
to be modularized. This requires constructs that define weaving rules, which can be
used to manipulate the execution flow, i.e. the genetic circuit.

Weaving rules are bundled into "Aspect classes"::
    
    class EmptyAspect(Aspect):
        def mainAspect(self):
            # advice must be registered here
            pass
            
Design Rules Example
--------------------

A simple example shows how an Aspect can be used to automatically weave RBS and
Terminator parts around Coding Regions:

    .. literalinclude:: /../aosb/examples/tutorial_designrules.py
    
The output of this program is::
    
    Promoter+RBS+CodingRegion(codesFor = GFP)+Terminator

In the following sections, the constructs introduced in the example will be covered
in detail.

The simple defines the "core concern", GFP coded under an unspecified Promoter,
in the CodingGFP Circuit *(lines 3-7)*. The DesignRules Aspect *(lines 9-23)* defines 
two advice methods, ``insertRBS'' and ``insertTerinator``. Each Aspect has to implement
a ``mainAspect()`` method, similarly to a Circuit's ``mainCircuit()``. During the
execution of ``mainAspect()``, all advice of the Aspect must be declared. In the example
*(lines 16 and 17)*, the two advice methods are attached two the appropriate PointCut and
declared using :py:func:`addAdvice() <aosb.core.Aspect.addAdvice>`.

Lastly, CodingGFP and DesignRules are given as inputs to the Weaver *(lines 25)*.

The Weaver now first constructs the classes and creates a list of all advice, by calling
DesignRule's ``mainAspect()``. Then, it calls CodingGFP's ``mainCircuit()`` method.
When the CodingRegion is added *(line 7)*, the Weaver is able to match the advice from
DesignRules and inserts a call to ``insertRBS()`` before adding the CodingRegion, and a
call to ``insertTerminator()`` after it.

Point Cuts
==========

A ``PointCut`` matches specific join points in the genetic circuit execution flow.

The :py:func:`Point Cut constructor <aosb.core.PointCut.__init__>` requires a
PartSignature and an operator of type ``PointCut.BEFORE`` / ``AFTER`` or ``REPLACE``, 
which specifies how the matching join point should be manipulated.

Simple Part Signatures
----------------------

In the `Design Rules Example`_ we have seen an example of a simple PartSignature::

.. code-block:: python

    PartSignature('*.CodingRegion+')
    
This part matches any part of type (or sub-type) ``CodingRegion``.

A Part Signature consists of three parts. Firstly, it can specify a namespace of a Part, 
i.e. the Circuit or Aspect which has added it. Secondly, it can specify the part itself.
Thirdly, it can optionally specify a Molecule the part should be connected to. Matching
is done on the name of the type.

.. code-block:: python

    NameSpaceTypeName.PartTypeName(MoleculeName)

Additionally, the wild card operator ``*`` will match any name, and the ``+`` will make
any type or subtype a match. Furthermore, a ``!`` at the beginning of any element of the
signature will invert it.

**Examples**

.. code-block:: python
    
    "Circuit+.BB*(*)"
will match any part, which has been added by a Circuit (i.e. not by an Aspect) and whose 
type name begins with "BB" (e.g. by naming convention, a BioBrick part). The molecule
connection is irrelevant, so ``(*)`` for the molecule element of the signature is
equivalent to leavning it out.

.. code-block:: python

    "Aspect+.Promoter+(TranscriptionFactor+)"
will match any Promoter (including subtypes such as NegativePromoter, PositivePromoter,
any any user-defined types) that has been added by an Aspect and is regulated by a 
TranscriptionFactor.

.. code-block:: python

    "!SimpleAspect.*(!GFP)"
will match any Part not being connected to GFP which has not been added by an Aspect
called SimpleAspect.

Thus, by constructing a sensible typing hierarchy of Parts and Molecules and by
establishing a rigorous naming convention, Point Cuts are able to select groups of 
Parts based on precise features.

Point Cut Expressions
---------------------

Additionally, Part Signatures can be connected into expressions, using the ``&``, ``|``
and ``%`` operators, which stand for boolean-and, boolean-or and concatenation, 
respectively. 

**Examples**

.. code-block:: python

    PartSelector('*.NegativePromoter+') | PartSelector('*.PositivePromoter+')
    
will match any part whose (sub)type is either ``NegativePromoter`` or ``PositivePromoter``.

.. code-block:: python

    PartSelector('*.*(TranscriptionFactor+)') & PartSelector('*.*(ReporterProtein+))
    
will match any part whose molecule is both a TranscriptionFactor and a ReporterProtein.

.. code-block:: python

    PartSelector('*.RBS+') % PartSelector('*.CodingRegion+')

will match any CodingRegion, which has an RBS part immediately before it.



Using these operators, complex Point Cut expressions can be built.
All operators are left-associative, so there is no clear precedence between operators. 
Rather, precedence should be explicitly defined using parentheses. 

Additionally, parts of a formula can be inverted using a ``PointCutExpressionNot()`` node,
which does not have an overloaded Python operator::

    PointCutExpressionNot('*.Terminator+')
    
will match any Part not matched by ``'*.Terminator+'``

Advice
======

Advice is the code woven into the execution flow.  An ``Advice`` consists of a PointCut,
to select the location of where the code should be inserted, and a method of the Aspect.

An advice method belongs to the Aspect, and can access and store attributes via the ``self`` parameter. An advice method must also accept a second Parameter called ``context``::

    def adviceMethod(self,context):
        # self.addPart() could be used here
        pass

``context`` is of type :py:class:`PointCutContext <aosb.core.PointCutContext>`, which has
a ``PointCutContext.part`` attribute, referencing the part that was matched by the 
PointCut of the advice. 

Additionally, ``context`` has an :py:class:`isWithin() <aosb.core.PointCutContext.isWithin>` method, which
can be used to search for Circuits or Aspects on the advice call stack. For example, this can be used to
make sure that an advice is not recursively executing on itself. 

Example: Print Advice Stack
---------------------------

Based on the previous `Design Rules Example`_ we can quickly add an aspect to print a stack trace:

.. literalinclude:: /../aosb/examples/tutorial_printstack.py

This will give the following output::

    CodingGFP add: Promoter
    CodingGFP,<__main__.DesignRules object at 0x7f8f42987a50> add: RBS
    CodingGFP,<__main__.DesignRules object at 0x7f8f42987a50> add: Terminator
    CodingGFP add: CodingRegion(codesFor = GFP)
    Promoter+RBS+CodingRegion(codesFor = GFP)+Terminator

``CodingGFP`` has a nicer string representation, which it inherits from Part (see Composites).

before and after Point Cuts
---------------------------

We have already encountered the simpler Before and After Point Cuts. They inject the advice code
immediately before or after the join point selected by the Point Cut, as would be expected.

.. figure:: /images/point_cut_before.png

    Advice weaving at a join point selected by a BEFORE Point Cut


.. figure:: /images/point_cut_after.png

    Advice weaving at a join point selected by an AFTER Point Cut
    
replace Point Cuts
------------------

.. figure:: /images/point_cut_replace.png

    Advice on a replace Point Cut is executed instead of the Part.

Precedence
----------

What if more than one Point Cut matches a given Join Point? Unless a precedence is explicitly 
set, the behavior is undefined.

``addAdvice()`` takes an optional third parameter - an integer between ``Advice.MINPRECEDENCE`` *(0)*
and ``Advice.MAXPRECEDENCE`` *(100)*

Advice which are added without specifying a precedence, are given minimal precedence by default. Higher precedence Advice is are deemed more important than those of low precedence. 

For two Advice sharing a BEFORE Point Cut, this means that the high precedence advice will execute **before** the low precedence one. If both advice have the same precedence, their order is undefined.

For two Advice sharing an AFTER Point Cut, the high precedence advice will execute **after** the low precedence one. If both advice have the same precedence, their order is undefined.

For two Advice sharing a REPLACEMENT Point Cut, the high precedence advice will execute, whereas any lower precedence advice will be ignored.

If many Point Cuts match a Join Point, first the before advice will execute starting from the highest precedence. After the last before advice, the part will be added. Then the lowest precedence after advice will execute until the highest after advice. If a replacement advice occurs at some point, any lower before or after advice will be ignored. However, all after advice of similar or higher precedence will still execute.

.. figure:: /images/point_cut_precedence.png

    In this example, the low advice and the matched Part will not be executed, as they have been replaced
    by the medium Advice

Type Advice
===========

Apart from normal Advice, which changes the execution flow, it is also possible to modify the Molecule
and Part types using type advice. For example, one Aspect could add sequence information to a whole range
of Parts; another could add modelling rules to Parts based on features selected by a ``PartSignature``.

Analogously to ``addAdvice()``, type advice can be added with 

Adding type advice to Parts
---------------------------

Analogously to adding new Advice with ``addAdvice()``, Type Advice can be 
added via :py:func:`addTypeAdvice() <aosb.core.Aspect.addTypeAdvice>`::

    def mainAspect(self):
        self.addTypeAdvice(PartSignature('*.*'),True,"isPart")
    
``addTypeAdvice`` requires three parameters: A ``PartSignature`` to select the Part, an
attribute to add to the Part type, and a name under which this Part should appear.

If the attribute is a method, it is given two parameters: ``self``, referring to the
Aspect, and ``part``, referring to the Part object::

    class AnAspect(Aspect):
        def mainAspect(self):
            self.addTypeAdvice(PartSignature('*.*'),self.typeAdviceMethod,"sayHello")
        
        def typeAdviceMethod(self,part)
            print "Hello from "+str(part)
            
Type Advice can also be added to ``Molecules`` using the same ``addTypeAdvice()`` method.
This requires changing the first parameter to a :py:class:`MoleculeSignature <aosb.core.MoleculeSignature>`::

    def mainAspect(self):
        self.addTypeAdvice(MoleculeSignature('TranscriptionFactor+'),True,"isTranscriptionFactor")
        
The ``MoleculeSignature`` is simply the element of the PartSignature within the parantheses.

Type Advice Example
-------------------

Here is a simple example to add a method to Promoter types to print if they are regulated or not.

.. literalinclude:: /../aosb/examples/tutorial_typeadvice.py

The output will be::

    Promoter is not regulated by a Molecule.
    NegativePromoter(regulatedBy = Protein) is regulated by a Molecule.

Weaver Output Advice
====================

The last item to cover is the :py:class:`WeaverOutput <aosb.core.Weaver.WeaverOutput>` class, a
container object holding the results of the Weaver compilation and returned by ``Weaver.output()``::
    
    compiledDesign = Weaver(ACircuit,AnAspect,AnotherAspect).output()
    
By default, ``WeaverOutput`` has two attributes. ``partList``, holding the list of the parts in order of execution,
and ``moleculeList`` a list of all types of Molecules used in the system. The class also overloads ``__str__`` to provide
a nice string output of the compiles design, which we have used in previous examples.

An Aspect can also declare output advice to the ``WeaverOutput``. For example, this allows an Aspect implementing a rule-based modelling
concern to define additional ``WeaverOutput`` methods, such as ``printModel()``.

The mechanism is very similar to Type Advice::

    def mainAspect(self):
        addWeaverOutput(self.newOutputMethod)
        
    def newOutputMethod(self,weaverOutput):
        pass
        
``addWeaverOutput()`` has only one parameter which must refer to a method of the Aspect. This weaver output advice method must accept
two parameters, ``self`` to refer to the Aspect, and ``weaverOutput`` to refer to the ``WeaverOutput`` object. Unlike
``addTypeAdvice()``, ``addWeaverOutput`` requires no name for the new attribute. Instead, the new method for ``WeaverOutput`` will
automatically have the same name.

Example: Print number of parts
------------------------------

.. literalinclude:: /../aosb/examples/tutorial_weaveroutput.py
