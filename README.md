synbioweaver
=============

### Installation
To use the package, the python module `synbioweaver` must be on the PYTHONPATH.

### Dependencies
The usual python dependencies are required for running the base functionality: `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`. If you would like to export designs into sbml then you also need `libsbml`. The more involved examples require additional tools and are outlined below

### Documentation
An overview and tutorial is provided at the following location
<http://synbioweaver.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>

### Examples
A number of simple examples to illustrate how the package works are included in the folder examples/tutorial

**Specifying different gene circuit designs and generating models**
examples/model-generation
The circuits include: 
* simple implementations of constitutive and inducible GFP expression
* the lux-AHL system
* the sender-receiver system found in Basu et. al. Spatiotemporal control of gene expression with pulse-generating networks (2004) <http://www.pnas.org/content/101/17/6355>
* the toggle-switch system found in Litcofsky et. al. Iterative plug-and-play methodology for constructing and modifying synthetic gene networks (2012) <https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.2205>
* the oscillator from Stricker et. al. A fast, robust and tunable synthetic gene oscillator (2008) <https://www.nature.com/articles/nature07389>

**Multicellular logic gates**
examples/logic-gates
This example is based on the XOR gate described in Tamsir et. al. Robust multicellular computing using genetically encoded NOR gates and chemical ‘wires’ (2011) <https://www.nature.com/articles/nature09565>

**Rule-based modelling**
examples/rule-based-model. 
A design for the repressilator is converted into a rule-based model specified in the Kappa language and then subsequently simulated stochastically using `KaSim`. This example requires `KaSim` version 3.5 to be installed in /usr/local/share. This can be downloaded as a binary from <https://github.com/Kappa-Dev/KaSim/releases>

**Automated model generation and simulation using GPUs**
This example is found in examples/context-simulation. For GPU based biochemical network simulation `CUDA`, `PyCUDA` and `cuda-sim` must be installed.
